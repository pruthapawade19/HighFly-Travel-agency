        <h1 class="heading">Agra: The Taj of City!</h1>

        <p>Agra is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, about 210 km south of
            the national capital New Delhi. With a population of roughly 1.6 million, Agra is the fourth-most populous
            city in Uttar Pradesh and twenty-third most populous city in India. Agra's period of historical importance
            began during Sikandar Lodi's reign, but the golden age of the city began with the Mughals. Agra was the
            first city of the subcontinent and the capital of the Mughal Empire under Mughal emperors Babur, Humayun,
            Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan. Under Mughal rule, Agra became a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and
            religion, and saw the construction of the Agra Fort, Sikandra and Agra's most prized monument, the Taj
            Mahal, built by Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his favourite empress. With the decline of the Mughal empire
            in the late 18th century, the city fell successively to multiple regional powers and finally the East India
            Company. After Independence, Agra has developed into an industrial town, with a booming tourism industry,
            along with footwear, leather and other manufacturing. The Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort are UNESCO World
            Heritage Sites. The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season, and is famous for
            its Mughlai cuisine. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur;
            and the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with Lucknow and Varanasi.
